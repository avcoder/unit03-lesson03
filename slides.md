- Note: `.git` `.gitignore`

# Git Branching and Merging
(30 min) What are branches? Why do we use them?

- Demo `git`:  `branch` `checkout` `switch` `merge`
1. Create a new branch `git branch feature/ticket01/add-user-auth`
1. Switch to the new branch `git checkout feature/ticket01/add-user-auth` or use `switch`
1. Make changes and commit on that branch
1. Switch back to main branch `git checkout main` or `git switch main`
1. Merge changes `git merge feature/ticket01/add-user-auth`
